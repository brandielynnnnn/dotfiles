## Brandie Ewing's Dotfiles
#### customizing linux system for efficiency

This is my personal dotfiles collection of custom homefiles, system installs, and vim configuring. It contains a homefile script for **Custom bash aliases** in bash environments, **Vim Customization** for development control and **Ansible** system install for managing and configuring nodes and modules. 

For use, Clone the repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brandielynnnnn/dotfiles.git
```
Install Pre-reqs 
```bash 
sudo apt-get install vim git python3
```

Copy folders to home directory and  Run scipts in homefiles, sys-installs, and vim-config for customized bashed environment. For improvements make more scripts on installing packages based on needs in environment.
