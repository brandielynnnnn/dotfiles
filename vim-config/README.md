## Vim configuration

This vim configuration consiist of two important files. The .vimrc is a config file for cp to home directory. Fortunally, the script ``vimplugs.sh`` copies the homefile in dotfiles repo to home directory. It also installs vundle package for vim configs and installs the plugins for vim. The directions are below. 

* Clone my personal dotfiles repository 

* Run script ``vimplugs.sh`` requiring ``https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim``

* Run vim and Check :PluginList
